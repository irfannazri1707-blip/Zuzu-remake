                    <p>Zuzu, I know that you have struggled with your self-image a lot and problems that you are not telling me. It hurts to know that everyday, there are still issues that arises within yourself that you just want to hide away from everyone.</p>
                    
                    <p class="highlight">However, do not ever think you're alone, your friends are always there for you.</p>
                    
                    <p>And even if they're not, I'm always here for you. I can lend you an ear to listen to, I can lend you a mouth to respond to your needs, I have arms and legs to come to you WHENEVER I can make my time available for you. I have a brain that I can think and use it to make stuff that would LIGHTEN you up!</p>
                    
                    <p>You might be thinking, "Oh, he's only doing this because he's just kind and like that to everyone". No. I don't do this for everyone. In fact, I only do this for you. Why? Because I really really really like you a lot and I care about you so much to the point that I even stayed up to write all of this for you.</p>
                    
                    <p class="fun-text">To show you that no matter how low you think of yourself, I ALWAYS THINK THAT YOU'RE MORE!!</p>
                    
                    <p>You're not unloveable at all Zuzu, in fact, Loving you is the most easiest thing in the world for me. Because all I need are just words and texts from you in order to feel so happy. There are many things that I want us to do together. I want to experience everything together at YOUR pace.</p>
                    
                    <p class="highlight">So please, before you think that you are unlovable, I AM LIVING PROOF THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOMEONE ELSE THAT LOVES YOU AND CHERISH YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE.</p>
                    
                    <p>So, until the day that you are able to let people in... I wanna be first-in-line, to be the person that you can trust and rely on. I want to be there as a partner together.</p>

                    <p>There are so many things that I wanna say to you but can't put into words.</p>
                    
                    <p>You always think that there is nobody who can "tolerate" you or "handle" you. But I don't think I have to do any of the "tolerating".</p>

                    <p>You're not a burden for having feelings. You don't need to earn patience or love. Whenever I'm doing something for/with you, it's like breathing in air.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is the easiest thing to do for me because I never had to fake myself around you. You don't need to be easier, happier, or less yourself for me to be here. Just by existing, you already have me around.</p>
                    
                    <p>I don't think that's tolerance, I think that's just my emotional willingness to you.</p>
                    
                    <p>It has always been you whenever I think about someone I like. There are others who are like you, but they are not YOU.. So that's why, I never gave up on showing you affection :]</p>
